# Elevator Speech
### Hello, I’m Lyncy Hodge. I’m a Savvy FS student and a cybersecurity student. I have passed the CompTIA Network+ exam, and the A+. I was always interested in coding and I found Savvy Coders. Now I’m excited for this opportunity to learn and later down the road find out where FS development and cybersecurity merge.


# Intro Speech
## I created this single page application because jiu jitsu is something my family is passionate about. This was my way of organizing and expanding on what I learn. This SPA acts as a journal, in that you can make add entries for lessons you take. You can create sub-entries and expand on these moves and add little details as you move through your jiu jitsu career. You can also pull videos from youtube and review moves that you learn, as well as create your competition plan.
